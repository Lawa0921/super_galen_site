          title: The Wonderful Adventure in Marine Leisure Management
          description: Studied at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology's
            Marine Leisure Management Department. I researched marine ecology with
            classmates and played on surfboards and sailboats. I led the department
            cheerleading team to second place and won a dragon boat race! Who says
            people who manage oceans can't manage code? Well, I really couldn't back
            then.

          description: Founded the camping site "Secret Travel" and learned the most
            important entrepreneurial skill - how to debug life on a mountain with
            no internet. Handled countless customer "requirement changes" (last-minute
            tent additions, extra people, postponements, cancellations). This experience
            gave me a deep understanding of what "Agile Development" really means.

          description: Passed the N1 Japanese proficiency test through self-study
            in one year. Discovered that learning Japanese is like programming - both
            involve dealing with a bunch of incomprehensible symbols. Kanji are like
            variable names, particles are like operators. This experience proved my
            self-learning ability - Google is the best teacher!

          description: Joined a programming bootcamp. First time seeing Ruby, thought
            it was a gemstone. From "puts 'Hello World'" to building a GitHub clone
            with Rails (yes, we really made a knockoff GitHub). Learned that MVC is
            not a convenience store and CRUD is not a swear word. Debugging until
            dawn every day, finally understood why programmers have dark circles.

          description: Joined an online education platform as a backend engineer,
            writing APIs with Ruby on Rails. Learned terms I'd never heard before
            like cache, backgroundjob, websocket. My PostgreSQL JOINs could make senior
            engineers cry. Most proud achievement - optimizing an API from 30 seconds
            to 3 seconds. Turned out I forgot to add an index. What's an index? I
            only learned that then.

          description: First time owning a project like a real engineer! From requirement
            interviews (listening to PM stories), system design (drawing lots of professional-looking
            architecture diagrams), to implementation and deployment (fixing bugs
            at midnight). Learned Git Flow, CI/CD, and the most important skill -
            how to politely tell PM "this requirement is impossible."

          description: Joined a blockchain bootcamp and finally understood that Gas
            isn't gasoline and smart contracts don't negotiate by themselves. Wrote
            my first smart contract in Solidity. Learned to use Hardhat for testing
            (free praise), IPFS storage (so decentralized you can't find where files
            are), and ethers.js integration (finally don't need to manually input
            private keys).

          description: Became a blockchain freelance developer, creating DFKRunner
            automation scripts - making DeFi Kingdoms NFT heroes automatically mine,
            fish, and garden. Using Node.js + harmony-js + ethers.js, cross-chain
            between DFK and Klaytn. Most satisfying achievement - NFTs making me money
            while I sleep! Also learned an important lesson - bugs in smart contracts
            are much more expensive than regular bugs (literally debugging with money).

            Elixir Phoenix. First time encountering functional programming, discovered
            that "immutable" isn't referring to my salary. Actor Model made me understand
            "let it crash" - turns out program crashes can be a design pattern! Using
            LiveView for real-time interaction, creating SPA effects without writing
            JavaScript (though I ended up writing lots of JS anyway). Managing AWS
            with Terraform + Ansible, learned IaC (Infrastructure as Code, not IC
            design).

            Maintaining core AI products, keeping server uptime <0.1% downtime - meaning
            my rest time is less than the server's. Current me - writing Tailwind
            until eye pressure spikes, Git has merged into my DNA.
